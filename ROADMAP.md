SCPN IEC Core — ROADMAP

# Roadmap

Planned work and implemented capability are kept strictly separate. Anything
listed under "Planned" carries no implementation, no code, and no claim in
this repository until it appears in the capability inventory with evidence.

## Implemented (repository infrastructure, not reactor capability)

- Domain manifest (`reactor-domain.json`) with validator.
- Derived Studio portfolio descriptor (`not_federated`) with drift check.
- Generated capability inventory (truthfully empty) with drift check.
- CONTROL adapter specification (contract only, no implementation).
- Local and workflow gate definitions (lint, typing, tests, coverage,
  REUSE, security audit, SBOM, documentation checks).

## Planned (no implementation exists; ordering is not a commitment)

1. **Device configuration model** — typed configuration policy for the
   IEC family (grid and virtual-cathode classes, well-depth envelopes,
   discharge modes), with evidence-maturity target
   `computational_prototype`.
2. **Diagnostic and clock semantics** — declared well, convergence, and
   yield channels with continuous-operation clock identities, aligned
   with the SCPN Phase Orchestrator semantic profile.
3. **Safety-envelope declaration** — machine-readable operational envelope
   (voltage, thermal, magnet, shielding bounds) consumed by the CONTROL
   adapter contract.
4. **CONTROL adapter implementation** — device-owned adapter against the
   published specification, with replay fixtures and HIL evidence,
   targeting `control_research_ready` only after replay and HIL
   acceptance.
5. **Solver seam consumption** — versioned consumption of exact
   `SCPN-FUSION-CORE` seams for potential-well and recirculation
   surfaces, strictly after the family migration gate proves exact
   replacement; no solver code is copied.
6. **Facility-data correlation** — preregistered acceptance contracts
   against identified facility or published experimental data, targeting
   `experiment_correlated` per capability.

## Not planned in this repository

Purely magnetic cusp confinement, magnetic mirrors, external-accelerator
beam-target systems, inertial and magneto-inertial systems, generic
controller mathematics, machine-protection logic, and any direct actuation
path.
