SCPN IEC Core — CONTROL adapter specification

# CONTROL adapter specification

**Adapter identifier:** `scpn-iec-core.control-adapter`

**Contract version:** `0.1.0-spec` (specification only — **no implementation
exists**)
**Consumer:** `SCPN-CONTROL` plugin protocol

This document is the device-owned contract through which a future IEC
adapter would supply device truth to the SCPN control plane. Publishing
this specification creates no capability and no claim: an implementation
may appear only with the replay fixtures and evidence the reactor family
standard requires for `control_research_ready`, and it enters CONTROL only
through CONTROL's installed public contract with real-surface tests.

## Authority model (non-negotiable semantics)

1. The adapter **supplies declarations and observations; it never
   actuates**. It exposes no verb that writes to plant hardware.
2. `SCPN-CONTROL` alone admits observations and forms `ControlAction`
   values. The adapter cannot construct, forward, or replay a
   `ControlAction`.
3. SPO semantic output consumed alongside adapter data is `review_only`
   (`actionable = false`); the adapter must not re-label it.
4. Independent machine protection retains the final veto on every plant
   path. The adapter declares the safety envelope; it does not implement
   protection.
5. Every adapter payload carries provenance (source, clock identity,
   contract version); CONTROL rejects payloads without it.

## Contract surfaces

### 1. Observation schema (device → CONTROL)

Declared per diagnostic channel:

- channel identifier and physical quantity with SI unit — including
  well-drive channels (cathode voltage and current, electron-gun and
  magnet currents for the Polywell variant), well-depth and
  potential-profile channels, core-convergence indicators, neutron-yield
  channels, and vacuum/gas-feed channels with exact definitions;
- coordinate convention (well-centre radial coordinate, grid or coil
  label) and spatial layout (scalar, radial profile, or detector array);
- sampling clock identity and timestamp semantics (continuous-operation
  time base with declared burst resolution);
- uncertainty representation (declared per channel; absent uncertainty is
  an explicit `unquantified` marker, never an implied zero);
- validity and quality flags with fail-closed semantics.

### 2. State schema (device → CONTROL)

- lifecycle phase (`conditioning`, `well_establishment`, `discharge`,
  `termination`, `terminated`) with monotonic transition semantics and
  device-truth event records for arcing, grid-thermal excursions, and
  virtual-cathode collapse;
- configuration identity: which registry configuration (`gridded_iec` or
  `polywell`), which well-formation hardware revision, and which
  configuration policy revision produced the run;
- device availability state for control research (simulation, replay, HIL;
  live plant states are out of scope for this contract version).

### 3. Actuator-capability declaration (device → CONTROL)

For each actuator class (well-drive supply programming, electron-gun and
magnet-coil programming for the Polywell variant, ion-source and gas-feed
programming, vacuum-system auxiliaries):

- declared capability envelope (bounds, slew limits, latency class) as
  device truth for CONTROL's admission checks — the quasi-steady
  discharge makes envelope-bounded slow adjustment declarable, still
  strictly as declaration and never as a command surface;
- explicit marker `direct_actuation: false`.

### 4. Safety-envelope declaration (device → CONTROL and protection review)

- machine-readable operational envelope (well voltage and current bounds,
  grid thermal limits, magnet and electron-gun bounds, X-ray shielding
  constraints with applicability domains);
- declared device-level hazard semantics for arcing, grid failure, and
  virtual-cathode collapse;
- statement of the independent machine-protection boundary this envelope
  is subordinate to.

### 5. Replay fixtures contract (evidence)

An implementation must ship replay fixtures that exercise every schema
above through CONTROL's real admission path: nominal discharges,
collapse and arcing sequences, boundary-of-envelope cases, invalid-payload
rejections, and clock-mismatch rejections. Fixtures are versioned with the
adapter and their digests recorded; HIL evidence is additionally required
before `control_research_ready` may be declared.

## Versioning rules

- `0.x` specification versions may change with a recorded revision note in
  this file and a manifest update in the same commit.
- From the first implemented `1.0.0`, changes follow semantic
  compatibility: breaking schema changes require a major version, a
  translation path or governed deprecation, and re-run producer/consumer
  evidence on both sides.
- The manifest (`reactor-domain.json` → `control_adapter`) always records
  the exact contract version; validator and drift checks keep the two
  files in agreement.
